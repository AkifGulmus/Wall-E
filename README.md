## About The Project

![example-screenshot](/images/exampleScreenshot.png)


This is a simple project that I created to get started with Vue and the concept and applications of unit testing. It is by no means intended to be a complete or standalone application.

Using Giphy's trending gifs API endpoint, it fetches the most trending 5 gifs on Giphy right now and displays them in an ordered fashion. When any of the gifs get clicked on, user is directed to the original Giphy page that the gif came from. UI or functionality-wise, that's all. The real deal of the project for me is getting familiar with and finding out how to integrate Vue concepts like componentization and the TDD I did  while developing every step of it. Using Jest as the testing framework, I aimed to learn about and then apply the best practices of testing and created unit tests for each component of the application with the highest code coverage possible.
